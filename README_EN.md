## Motivation
Throughout my career so far, I have had the opportunity to work on various software projects, including several smaller projects that I worked on in my free time. These experiences have led me to realize that software development is a field that fulfills me and offers me space for continuous personal and professional growth. Although I gained many valuable experiences in my previous role, I realized that I want to fully focus on software engineering.

Therefore, I am now looking for a job that will allow me to develop in this area and push my skills further. I am a team player who enjoys collaborating with others on common goals. I learn quickly and have no problem adapting to new tasks or environments. I like challenges because they motivate me to improve and find new ideas.
